# OptiRocket : Rocket staging optimisation

Originally, this project was a school assignment. But the subject was so cool that we decided to develop the code further and build a package out of it.

## Concept

You want to send a satellite to orbit ?
Design the best rocket for the job !

This packages automatically computes the most optimized staging and propellants of your rocket for the mission specified.

## User Guide

the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) describes how to use the package.

## Installation

The package will be available on PyPi, and installable using `pip` but only when ready (not yet...)

For now, feel free to clone the repo and contribute ðŸ˜‰ We recommend [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.

## Origins

This project was initially a school project, info is in the file [School Project](SchoolProject.md)
